## A Twist of Fate

I’d be lying if this happened overnight lmao, so lets start how it all began. Before I started developing a game, the task given for me by my boss (Let’s call him Chris from now on :3) was to recover an old website that has inventory management, and sales management capabilities for small businesses and make it online on our servers and accessible in different devices. Unfortunately this didn’t end well, mostly due to my lack of experience which lead to project drought. 

It kind off made my confidence a bit low because I really thought this would lit the fire of me working for servers and managing stuff in IT field for long term. Then one day out of nowhere Chris talked to me asking if I’m interested doing game development. At first I was skeptical about it, since I have no idea and experience how to do it. I mean have my thoughts making a game way back in high school but I shrugged it off due to financial reasons, but right now there’s actual opportunity to do it.

I thought about it for a couple of minutes because my doubts started to creep in. I guess this is normal when you are facing the unknown. It made me think if I’m capable to do it, the feeling of doubt is so strong it made me shiver but I fight it off. I thought this might be a good start, I’m young so I can take a risk right now and see what will happen. I accepted Chris’s offer to develop a game despite I lack of experience. The only experience I have is years of experience playing diverse games, maybe that helps? I don’t know lol.  

## Learning the ropes

Starting out was pretty smooth since Chris provided me a lot of Udemy courses for game development, game design theories, pixel art, android game development. Particularly, those Udemy courses are about game development using the game engine called “Godot”. We chose to use Godot since its an open source. At first I was a bit hesitant to use Godot to be honest because most of the commercial games are made using Unity or Unreal Engine. But I just thought it would be nice a challenge if we can make a commercial game using Godot so people can see that this open source game engine is capable of producing a game. 

On the other hand I had a blast learning and watching those Udemy courses. It gave me ideas and methodologies how to develop small games. On hindsight, I was thinking on staying a way slowly on depending from tutorials because I don’t wanna get stuck in tutorial hell. For sure some of you have been on that situation and I don’t want to make it a habit when creating games early on. Although tutorials are nice, I feel like it will give me limitation on what I can do moving forward. 

For the game engine’s programming side, I learned that Godot uses Gdscript, a programming language custom made for Godot. I had fun learning it since the syntax looks like python and I heard its actually base on python. I didn’t had problem understanding most of it since during my college days I learned how to program using python. The only part I think I had a hard time is when it comes to logic, like making systems or features and how to incorporate them with other ones in order to make them work in unison.

## The Vision Board

When Chris asked me if I want to venture into game development, he already have a story and idea on how the game will be. But since we are starting as a beginner especially when it comes to the technology we decide to learn it first before setting up the path on developing the game idea Chris had for years. I read the story and the script Chris provided and after that I started imagining how the world will be and how each scenes will occur, I had a blast planning about it!

I did some small prototypes to see what Godot can do and couldn’t. In order to test those prototypes we planned on making a demo game first so we can see where we at and see if we can really make a working game. This was a fun stage for me because I can fuck around and find out lol. It helped me learn some stuff especially on how to use Gdscript and on how to navigate Godot’s different features.

## Mind’s Eye Opened

Weeks has passed into developing our demo game I realize that making a game isn’t that easy especially when your fixing bugs and you couldn’t figure out despite investigating it for hours on end. This made me remember way back when I was getting mad on the games I’ve played due to bugs, I started feel sorry for the developers lol. Now I’m on their side from now on especially when players are mocking the development team. 

Something changed on me as well, when I’m playing games from time to time. Before, whenever I am playing I just mindlessly play without inspecting too much on the game world or game features, like I’m just playing normally the way I play. However, right now when I play, I started to inspect too much on different things like checking how controls work and wondering how did the developer did it, same with the other game features I encounter. I feel like I become like my friends who work in Architecture, whenever we are outside hanging out they always check how each structures in establishment has been made. The same thing happens on but on games lol. 

## Breaking Through the Fog

Of course my journey in game development hasn’t been all highs; I’ve definitely encountered  

some lows along the way. I think one of my memorable hurdle was during I implemented a premade inventory system on my prototype demo game. When I realized it doesn’t work they way I want to, I tried to rollback by deleting the newly added code, for some reason my prototype doesn’t work. I tried tinkering with it back and fort to fix it but it doesn’t work anymore. Since I didn’t upload that prototype in Github, I have no choice but to re-do it from the start. It was a hassle and from that I started using Github moving forward. Don’t be like me guys please kekw. 

Second hurdle I encountered was during the early stage of making the demo game me and Chris planned. I wasn’t really confident on how it worked because it feels incomplete. Aside from that, I didn’t enjoy it while I play that demo. One thing it had problem also is making a way for Chris to test it in different devices, since Chris is always on the fly, most of the time he only have access to virtual machines. But the good thing is, Godot has web export, so each prototype I made can be posted on websites like [itch.io](http://itch.io) then Chris can test it there. 

Since I’m not satisfied with the first demo I made, I decided to go back in the drawing board. I set my sails to discover new game features like bullet hell mechanic, scene transition, save and load, dialogue manager and many more. To be honest I’m kind off scared during this time because I don’t want to disappoint Chris. I want to cherish the opportunity he gave to me. I was also thinking that there’s only a few people who believes in me and I want to prove to them that the person they put faith into is the right one.

Everything went well after a few weeks of developing the second demo. I saw what I can do, and it put a fire on me to do more. Although I still lack on many aspects of game development, I’m looking for ways to improve so I can produce a well made game for people.

## Future Bound

Since we are done making the demo game, we are already planning our next steps especially learning how to publish games in different platform like steam, Android, IOS, Switch, Xbox, PlayStation. Aside from that we are already setting our goals into producing our first commercial game called “Drunk Pedestrians”. I am excited and scared at the same time because I know the path I am taking is not easy but I know that it is rewarding. Right now I don’t wanna stop although sometimes my doubts still creeps in. But I do believe that sometimes we need to take a leap of faith to see the other side, and that’s what I will do. 

Thank you for reading this blog post.
